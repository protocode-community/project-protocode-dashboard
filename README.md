## Background
The goals for this repository are:

1. Learning to work with APIs, asynchronous JS and promises
2. To provide beginners a first experience contributing to open source projects.
3. Teaching a Git(Hub) workflow for collaboration with a number of other contributors.
4. Building your GitHub activity & contribution Profile to showcase what you achieved since starting your dev journey. 

## Usage
- For now, either comment out the unsplash API call, or paste your ACCESS KEY - and don't forget to remove it before pushing to git. We are looking for a way to make a public call or maybe set up dot-env to work with environment variables. 
- In your chrome browser go to chrome://extensions and 'load unpacked files' from your project directory (or a duplicate).
- It should work now - Open a new tab - allow location for weather API.
